--> Regarding the dataset :- 

The "data.csv" used in this project is the result of data wrangling and cleaning done on three different spreadsheets collected from https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start.
The three spreadsheets depict monthly data on employment, hourly wages and GDP of an industrial sector grouped monthly. 

--> Regarding the ML algorithm :- 

This notebook will be focusing on timeseries forecasting using gradient boosting decision tree regression algorithms. Specifically, two packages, 
one from sklearn and other one from LightGBM are used. 


## Some general information that might be useful before proceeding ahead:- 
* The highest computation time taken by a cell in this notebook is :- 1m 30s, which does the hyperparameter search. 
* This was measured on a 4 core CPU 16GB RAM.
* Keeping above conditions in mind, there is no need to use GPUs for running this notebook.
* Libraries used are :- 
    * Sklearn
    * Pandas
    * Numpy
    * Seaborn
    * Matplotlib
    * LightGBM
        * To install directly :- *pip3 install lightgbm*
        * To install in conda env :- *conda install -c conda-forge lightgbm*
